# whoami

A law graduate with a deep interest in how things work (or don't, as the case often is). I have been professionally educated in law, and self-educated in cybersecurity and my passion regarding which to pursue as a career has been clear for some time; though I will admit it is unfortunate, given that I have a degree in the other.

Though my use of GitHub has been non-existent up to this point, I hope to remedy the situation moving forward. For now, my intentions are to upload various past projects which may be worth sharing, and diligently post new ones.

This repo will update as I find the time and words to tell my story from the beginning and in full.
