A law graduate with a deep interest in how things work (or don't, as the case often is). I have been professionally educated in law, and self-educated in cybersecurity and my passion regarding which to pursue as a career has been clear for some time; though I will admit it is unfortunate, given that I have a degree in the other.

Though my use of GitHub has been non-existent up to this point, I hope to remedy the situation moving forward. For now, my intentions are to upload various past projects which may be worth sharing, and diligently post new ones.

This repo will update as I find the time and words to tell my story from the beginning and in full.

notes to be integrated into future updates – visible to those interested – these will be expanded upon and placed into the main body of the text as I find the time. The notes are for me and are therefore a little incoherent but I don’t see a reason to keep them from view.

1. Inspirations and aspirations

    • To work as a security-researcher/penetration-tester/consultant or such similar position in the legal field. Legal operations often contain the most sensitive data which, if breached, could have a catastrophic impact on those involved, and the wider community. This is not a short-term goal, but I have a valuable insight into the filed that most security researchers do not have the luxury of having: I have worked and trained in the field for several years. Surface of attack, social-engineering angles and typical computer based operations are just some of the areas which I am naturally familiar.
      
    • I am interested in the field of artificial intelligence and neural networks training itself, using an opposing digital adversary. A typical example would be AlphaGo (https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far). Imagine for a moment, a red-team/blue-team battle, which was completely or partially controlled by a computer. Not merely an advanced scanner, but more; an active and reactive programme designed to compromise a network, while being hunted by its inside counterpart. I see no reason why, given the time and resources, we could not make a programme that could outperform any security team.
       
    • Chris Hadfield and his vocalisation of his work with NASA is part of what lead me to pursue this kind of work. I have always been a jack-of-all-trades kind of person who would much rather know 90% of everything, than 99% of a something. Chris Hadfield is quite inspirational when he discusses the work which goes into putting people into space and is particularly clear on the point that an astronaut needs to know “a lot about everything”. I have found that security-research is much the same; it is no good knowing everything about hacking wordpress, if your target uses wix. Both the ‘know everything’ attitude, and the precision needed in both fields serve as inspiration for me to carry on; though I will concede, it’s probably cooler to be an astronaut.
